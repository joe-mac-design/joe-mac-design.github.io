                    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
                    <p>Our team received the “Origins of the Laoich” Brief, which asks for a Digital Card Game based upon the
                        show of the same name.
                        It asks us to utilise the world the show has built and to showcase scottish monsters/legends/myths and
                        heroes.
                        The Project is to be an expansion of the client's IP, they want this project to be part of their world to
                        increase their fanbase.</p>

                        <li>The portfolio is professionally presented, drawing consistently from research to justify design decisions, ideation and iteration.</li>
                        <li>This is an exemplary design portfolio, you demonstrate excellent ability for design, from developing excellent documentation to visualize gameplay through flowcharts and sketches, to following rigorous pipelines going from concepting and ideation through paper prototyping and testing onto implementation and iteration</li>
                        <li>I want to particularly flag-up the documentation produced throughout, the flow-charts and diagrams are professionally presented and work great for demonstrating loops, the design documents communicate clearly the rules and principles for the design of various features, truly excellent design abilities evidenced here! This is particularly impressive as the bulk of the design was done by you as the other designer in the team showed little engagement and you did this in addition to team-lead, producer and sound design responsibilities.</li>
                        <li>You have demonstrated excellent organisation and leadership skills, making excellent use of Jira to plan and keep the project running smoothly, there was clear communication with all team members and everyone knew their tasks and deadlines. Excellent work.</li>
