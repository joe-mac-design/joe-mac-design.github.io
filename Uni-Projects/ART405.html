                    <h3>Project Aim</h3>
                    <p>The aim of my research project is to investigate how the user experience and user interface can
                        be improved for young people in education (11-16).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Research Questions</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>How can the User Experience/User Interface be improved for younger audiences?</li>
                        <li>How can the User Experiences/User Interface aid in effective education?</li>
                        <li>Explore User Experience/User Interface Design for young people in education.</li>
                        <li>How can Environmental theming be implemented into a User Interface?</li>
                        <li>What makes a good User Experience/User Interface?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Literature Review - Undertake UX/UI research to help inform me of good/bad UX/UI design.
                            What the current trends are and how to onboard, balance cognitive load and how to keep users
                            motivated/engaged to achieve their goals.</li>
                        <li>Practical Development - Following on from research, I can develop low-fidelity Adobe XD
                            wireframes, high-fidelity Adobe XD wireframes and implement into unity engine.</li>
                        <li>Game Analysis - Undertake game analysis to develop an understanding of pre-existing
                            game/apps user flows and user interfaces.</li>
                        <li>Iterative Design - Using the iterative design process to conceptualize, prototype, test and
                            evaluate my project.</li>
                        <li>Post-Mortem - Conduct a post-mortem on my work from start to finish covering all the above
                            objectives.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigation</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="timeline-body">I measured the navigation from "Point A" to "Point B", throughout
                                many of the cases the objective was; Navigate from the Main Menu to the "Game Scene".
                                The majority of the cases did this well, requiring minimal clicks, some taking further
                                steps such as Minecraft, a subjectively convoluted menu system requiring far too many
                                menu navigations to get into a game.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Consistency</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="timeline-body">Most cases had consitant visual language with repest to their own
                                game. Minecraft, however, had inconsistencies spread throughout its UI, some icon
                                elements being 2D and some being 3D.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Clarity</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="timeline-body">All test cases had good clarity, through the use of either
                                Typography or Iconography, they got the message across.</p>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Accessibility</li>
                        <ul>
                            <p class="timeline-body">Acessibility is where the majority of the cases struggle, some do
                                however include forms of accessible options but there is still much to improve in this
                                area.</p>
