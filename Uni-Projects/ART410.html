                    <p>This research project focuses on the development of a user experience (UX) and user interface
                        (UI) educational experience aimed at raising awareness for river clean-up and environmental
                        education among young people in education (ages 11-16).</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Literature Review - Undertake UX/UI research to help inform me of good/bad UX/UI design.
                            Identify what the current trends are and how to onboard, balance cognitive load and how to
                            keep users motivated/engaged to achieve their goals.</li>
                        <li>Game Analysis - Undertake game analysis to develop an understanding of pre-existing
                            game/apps user flows and user interfaces.</li>
                        <li>Practical Development - Based on research develop low-fidelity Adobe XD wireframes,
                            high-fidelity Adobe XD wireframes and implement into unity engine. Using the iterative
                            design process to conceptualize, prototype, test and evaluate my project.</li>
                        <li>Post-Mortem - Conduct a post-mortem on all aspects of the project work covering the above
                            objectives.</li>

                        which led me to
                        break down the gamification principles of Mastery, Autonomy, and Purpose for easier
                        understanding and application in my project. These principles align with the desire to master
                        a topic, feel a sense of autonomy and control, and contribute to something larger than oneself
                        through constructivist learning.

                    <p class="timeline-body">The above figure showcases a user flow chart designed for rote learning.
                        This flowâ€™s goal is to
                        introduce the player to a new pollution type each individual lesson for a total of 3 lessons. At
                        the end of each lesson the user then takes a quiz to gauge how much of the information they
                        have processed. This structure of learning means each lesson has more information for the
                        end user to consume and memorise before taking the quiz.

                    <p class="timeline-body">Under the constructivist learning framework, each lesson would be a mini
                        game,
                        where the user gets to interact and learn. These lessons can range from simple activities like
                        sorting recyclables to more advanced gameplay, such as identifying types of pollution by
                        testing a virtual river with real-world technologies. This approach promotes active thinking
                        and problem-solving, allowing users to actively engage with the content.

                    <p class="timeline-body">Rote learning offers benefits such as the ability to quickly learn facts
                        and statistics through
                        memorization and repetition. In the context of this project, rote learning could have been
                        implemented through quizzes that test the user's knowledge of facts and statistics.</p>
